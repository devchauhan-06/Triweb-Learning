# HTML-CSS-JS

In this project I have used HTML , CSS & JavaScript to create a interactive game in which you can enter a user, choose a position, and display that text in one of four block spaces.



## Features

- Input button to enter text.

- Four buttons, one for each block, to display the text in that block.

- Erase button to remove the text.
