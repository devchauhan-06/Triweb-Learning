# HTML

Welcome to the HTML Directory! Here I have used the core components of HTML and made two small projects, namely a form and a timetable.

## Projects

### Form.html

Form.html serves as a basic registration form, demonstrating core HTML form components such as input fields, labels, and buttons. 

### Timetable.html

Timetable.html is a basic personal timetable, demonstrating the use of the `table`,`tr`,`td` tags of html.
