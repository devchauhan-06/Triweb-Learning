# TypeScript 

Welcome to the TypeScript  directory! In this section, we've been exploring TypeScript and its applications in web development. Our primary focus has been on the conversion of Express.js code into TypeScript, along with the exploration of fundamental concepts like routers, controllers, and modules. Inside, you'll find practical examples and exercises to help you understand the basics of using TypeScript in Express.js projects.

## Understanding Routers, Controllers, and Models

In the context of TypeScript web development:

- **Router**: Serves as the navigator for URL routes, directing incoming requests to the corresponding controller methods.

- **Controller**: Responsible for managing HTTP requests and crafting responses, acting as an intermediary between routes and the actual functionality of the application.

- **Model**: These structures represent data and define how information is organized and manipulated within the application. Typically, models are employed to interact with databases or external data sources.
